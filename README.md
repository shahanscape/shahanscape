## About Me

I'm a CS graduate who finds joy in building tools and automating everyday tasks. My tech journey is fuelled by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems—one line of code at a time. Backend development and scripting are where I spend most of my time.

Building tools that make sense (most of the time)

I’m always excited to work on projects where I can put my skills to good use—whether building from scratch or smoothing out existing systems. If you’re working on something cool or just want to chat about tech (or memes), let’s connect!
