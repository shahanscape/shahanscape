# Hello, I'm Shahaan

I'm a CS graduate who finds joy in building tools and automating everyday tasks. My tech journey is fuelled by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems—one line of code at a time. Backend development and scripting are where I spend most of my time.

Building tools that make sense (most of the time)

I’m always excited to work on projects where I can put my skills to good use—whether building from scratch or smoothing out existing systems. If you’re working on something cool or just want to chat about tech, let’s connect!
